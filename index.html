        <td>Significance:This quote by Muhammad Ali is outstanding becuase his message is for others to keep on going.
        He explains that even he hated training even though he is the greatsest boxer to ever live.
        He never wanted to give up becuase he knew he would regret it for the rest of his life.
        This persoanlly impacts my life becuase I really don't like school but want to have a great life in the future.
        Therefore I need to continue to put my best effort foward to acheive my goal, otherwise I will be disappointed with my decisions  in the future.
